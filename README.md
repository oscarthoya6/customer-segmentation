Initialization,Assignment,Update and Repeat.



For this project will work with the following:
CustomerID : Unique identifier for each customer.
Gender
Age of the customer.
Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1-100)

Analysis

    Target group would be cluster 2 which has a high Spending score and high income.
    59% of cluster 2 shoppers are women - look for ways to attract these customers using a marketing campaign targeting popular items in this cluster.
    Cluster 4 presents an interesting opportunity to market to the customers for sales event on popular items.
